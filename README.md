# Bank Teller Application
 
This is an application made for a school project using Visual Basic .NET. It is meant to showcase the creation of a GUI application with file reading and writing capability by allowing you to find an account from a file by its account number, deposit and withdraw money from it, and write transaction logs to a text file. To run, download the v1 release, unzip it, and run the executable. The valid account numbers are 10000, 11111, and 20000.
